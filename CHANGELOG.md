## 1.1.0

Issues closed:

* create universal configuration, accept params from cmdargs, dart-define, etc #213
* allow Manager to load and display a Report without existence of worker #211
* GoldenDiffPage: set FilterQuality be none if zoom in (physical size much larger), and mid if zoom out #206
* GoldenDiffPage: allow pan/zoom an image, and other images should synchronously pan/zoom the same location #205
* GoldenDiffPage: compute pixelwise difference and show it #204
* GoldenDiffPage: allow arrow up/down key to navigate #203
* for updateGoldens, give a GUI to check golden files git diff #201
* macos + flutter 3.0, fail to compile #199
* migrate to flutter 3.0 #198
* add "root finder" to easily find the root widget #197
* `Mark.repaintBoundary` flag does not work when in combination with goldens #196
* when golden fails because "image sizes do not match", should still provide visual diff #195
* improve the "screenshot panel", especially when it is showing golden images #192
* when `generateFailureOutput` (i.e. one golden fails), currently it outputs one log, so (1) it will not remove log if with retry it succeed (2) tons of log exists #191
* create "super-run-id", and let Report and Video output to subfolders of a folder named by superRunId, such that different super-runs are naturally grouped #190
* gRPC error on M1 Macos #182
* configure macos Manager such that it can be compiled into release executables - currently can always use `flutter run/flutter profile` even without doing this #181
* manage golden `failure`s, generate them onto convenient_test data dirs #180
* explicitly show which golden test fails, by marking them on LogEntry (or throwing exceptions at the locations expectLater fails) #179
* visualize golden test failures clearly in our Manager #178
* "match golden" errors if the match fails #177
* display icon name instead of the default hex number if using `find.byIcon` #176
* implement "append text to TextField" - current `enterText` will replace all text #175
* add sticky header for log panel, such that know which test is looking at - possibly show group names & test name; only visible if the topmost visible item is a log entry #174
* make route name matcher have better description #171
* make text of matchers like `findsOneWidget` more brief #170
* beautify "section" log entry UI, let users easily see this is section header #169
* add `Mark.repaintBoundary` parameter to easily add RepaintBoundary at test time for goldens #168
* implement two-finger gestures #167
* add various gesture detection tests #166
* in ci mode, when manager has started but worker has not yet started, should gracefully handle this case #165
* improve logging in ci mode: at least know which test is executing and how many remain #163
* add a hint text indicating "all tests finished" or "running some tests" #162
* maybe improve grammar: `t.get(find.text('hi')).tap()`/`.should(...)` -> `find.text('hi').tap()`/`.should(...)` #159
* make "logging reports to files" optional #157
* make write-file paths into sub-directories, currently all into the root temp dir making it messy #156
* further improve the top toolbar, since we are going to add more buttons and it will overflow #152
* Using outdated get_it version #150
* allow dynamically configure number of retries in panel #149
* when test name has special char like "+", regex fails #148
* exception when finished running tests in isolation mode #145
* for flaky tests, the "play video" button only plays the *first* video among all, instead of all videos #142
* do not show full error dialog, but collapse it by default and allow expand #141
* use hashcode+conflict-then-change to generate Test/Group `id` that is stable across hot-restarts #140
* add `dart-code-metrics`, especially check "access map operator[] with wrong key type", because things like #136 will easily have such problems #137
* avoid referencing Test/Group via `id`, because they do not preserve across hot-restarts - use `name`s instead #136
* When tap to run a test, have NPE error for `_GroupInfoSectionBuilder._buildHeader` #135
* bug: after tapping "play video" button, no video is shown #134
* still use names to identify Test/Group instead of the newly proposed id; but throw error if there are duplicated names #133
* Test/Group id should stay stable across hot-restarts - because in "isolation mode" and with #130, we use id to identify tests across hot restarts #132
* protobuf should use int64 instead of int32 for (new) id, since we use snowflake which is 64bit #131
* generate and use unique `id`s to determine tests and groups, since currently used test `name`s can be duplicate #130
* remove entryLocator, since test name is prefixed with group name, so no need to use group name to locate test name #129
* flutter test seems to allow *duplicated* names (even in same groups), but we rely on names to locate tests #128
* improve the "header panel" since too many items now #127
* remove the ManagerRpcService (abstraction layer above grpc to Manager), since will use new approach for CI mode #126
* let VideoDisplayStore/VideoPanel understand existence of multiple videos (currently only understand one) #125
* add a boot time config to specify whether to enable "hot-restart for every test" mode #124
* when in "hot-restart for every test" mode, also hot restart when a test is flaky and want to re-execute #123
* make the to-be-implemented "hot-restart for every test" an configurable optional feature #119
* refactor "ci mode" from pure-worker approach into the manager-aided approach #118
* extract pure-dart "manager_dart" from the "manager" package, such that it can run without gui; extract common_dart from common as well #117
* extensive golden support #116
* make generated id in worker be unique even across VM hot restart, by using a snowflake-like approach #115
* hot-restart every time a test is to be executed to improve isolation #113
* the intro video uploaded to youtube is blur #112

* mimic flutter official "integration test" tutorials, and put it in our example, to show how the same thing can be more convenient #97
* improve the example package's main.dart and integration_test code #96
* doc: add enough screenshots and mini-videos(or gifs) to each feature, since a picture worth a thousand words #95
* build a "profiling" build and see whether it is smooth - if not, fix it #92
* for half-visible entries, should also jump (unless it has too large height) #90
* change ScrollPhysics of the command panel, otherwise when using ScrollablePositionedList's jump, will have unwanted spring effects #89
* create "hover mode" toggle, only if enabled, hovering an entry will have effects #86
* add a button, only play video of this specific test, and stop once finished, instead of playing the whole video of many tests #84
* let CommandInfoPanel be a (real) ListView, instead of lots of nested Columns, otherwise performance bad #83
* when highlighting a logentry, must scroll it to make it visible, if it is originally not visible #82
* implement VideoPlayerController for dart_vlc #81
* maybe add a banner in app, showing last log entry, to accurately see what is happening at that time #80
* maybe use external vlc player and communicate with it #79
* add "open externally" button for video #78
* create example page that displays a counter in order to test video functionality #76
* the "seek" of vlc video player seems bad #75
* add a fine-grained play position bar #74
* automatically detect vmservice is alive or not, before sending operations like restart #67

* run tests selected by a provided customized regex #62
* run a whole group of tests (currently, only "all tests" or "one single test") #61

* for failed assertions, add a "just before fail" snapshot #58
* when calling and waiting "hot restart app", give some visual feedback #56
* add a "halt" button, which forcefully stop the running tests, while preserving all logs #55
* in manager, detect whether vmservice is disconnected and show corresponding errors #54
* add time information to raw logs #53
* when running in ci mode, should auto exit process when done #51
* generate prebuilt binaries for `convenient_test_manager` for releases #50
* bug: state status is not cleared across runs #48
* (low priority) slight optimization: use a "string pool", such that no need to repeat test/group name (Strings) over and over again, and only need to use integer (pool indices) #46
* check tests with same name (but different groups) - should not be buggy in such cases #45
* avoid hardcode `managerHost` in MyConvenientTestSlot example (otherwise cannot run on other computers) #44
* reportRunnerMessage has error for tearDownAll #43
* let Manager app runnable on Windows, MacOS and Linux (currently only MacOS) #40
